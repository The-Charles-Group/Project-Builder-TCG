# Agency Project Builder

## Overview

This project is a web-based Agency Project Builder designed to streamline the proposal creation process for creative and digital agencies. It analyzes Request for Proposal (RFP) content to suggest relevant deliverables, builds project scenarios based on different complexity and tier combinations, calculates pricing using role rates and hours, and generates timeline projections with built-in slack. The system aims to automate and enhance the efficiency of creating project estimates and timelines, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy in project proposal generation.
