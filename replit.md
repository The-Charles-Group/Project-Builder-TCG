# Agency Project Builder

## Overview

This project is a web-based Agency Project Builder designed to streamline the proposal creation process for creative and digital agencies. It analyzes Request for Proposal (RFP) content to suggest relevant deliverables, builds project scenarios based on different complexity and tier combinations, calculates pricing using role rates and hours, and generates timeline projections with built-in slack. The system aims to automate and enhance the efficiency of creating project estimates and timelines.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) for the REST API.
- **Data Processing**: Pandas DataFrames for handling Excel/CSV data, calculations, and manipulations.
- **File Handling**: Supports parsing of PDF and DOCX documents, and Excel file uploads.
- **CORS**: Configured to allow cross-origin requests.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (framework-agnostic).
- **UI Pattern**: Single-page application with a step-based workflow.
- **Styling**: Uses CSS custom properties for theming, including a dark mode.
- **State Management**: Client-side caching for options and scenario data.

### Data Storage Pattern
- **Primary Storage**: Excel/CSV files serve as the main source for business rules and configuration data.
- **Data Models**: In-memory DataFrames are loaded from spreadsheets to define tasks, deliverables, pricing rules, rate cards, timeline parameters, scaling factors, bundle configurations, hour allocations, and scenario templates.

### Core Business Logic
- **RFP Analysis**: Extracts key information from RFPs to suggest deliverables.
- **Scenario Building**: Generates project scenarios with varying complexity and tier combinations.
- **Pricing Engine**: Calculates costs using blended or role-based rate bands.
- **Timeline Calculation**: Determines project duration, incorporating configurable slack.
- **Export Capability**: Generates Workfront-compatible project structures.

### API Design
- Provides RESTful endpoints for data loading, options retrieval, and scenario generation.
- Supports file uploads for RFP documents and Excel configuration files.
- Uses JSON for configuration data and calculated scenario responses.
- Serves static files for frontend assets.
